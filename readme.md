🧠 TrevorBot — Discord’s Operational Diagnostician

TrevorBot is a Discord bot powered by Azure Functions and Azure OpenAI, designed for teams that thrive on chaos, structure, and unsolicited commentary. Trevor doesn’t just respond — he analyzes, judges, and occasionally helps.

🚀 Features
/ping

Checks if Trevor is alive. He usually is. Still cynical.

/teams gracze: Konrad,Janusz,Jan,Bartosz

Splits the provided list of players into two teams. If they’re uneven — Trevor sees. And disapproves.

/ask question: <text>

Connects directly to Azure OpenAI.
Trevor reads your question, consults the neural gods, and responds concisely.
He’s contractually obligated to be helpful, but not necessarily kind.

🧰 Tech Stack

Azure Functions — webhook-based backend for Discord Interactions

Azure OpenAI Service — GPT-4o model powering /ask command

Discord Interactions API — full slash command support

C# (.NET 8) — backend logic and dependency injection

Trevor Personality Engine™ — sarcasm-driven orchestration layer

🧩 Summary

TrevorBot is equal parts automation and attitude.
He listens, computes, and replies faster than your manager — and with slightly more empathy.
