# 🧠 TrevorBot — Discord's Operational Diagnostician

TrevorBot is a Discord bot built on **Azure Functions** and **Azure OpenAI**, designed for teams that thrive on chaos, rituals, and judgmental automation.  
He doesn’t just respond — he observes, analyzes, and occasionally helps.

## 🚀 Features

### `/ping`
Checks if Trevor is alive.  
He usually is. Still cynical.

### `/teams gracze: Konrad,Janusz,Jan,Bartosz`
Splits the provided list of players into two teams.  
If they’re uneven — Trevor sees all. And judges.

### `/ask question: <text>`
Connects directly to **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)**.  
Trevor reads your question, consults the neural gods, and answers briefly and precisely.  
He’s helpful by contract, but not necessarily polite.
